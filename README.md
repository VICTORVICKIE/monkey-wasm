# Monkey Lang Interpreter - Rust WebAssembly Implementation

This is the WebAssembly (WASM) implementation of the Monkey Lang Interpreter, a simple programming language designed for educational purposes. The Monkey language is dynamically typed and features a C-like syntax.

The WebAssembly version allows you to execute Monkey code in a web browser using wasm-bindgen.

## Modes

- Lexer: The interpreter includes a lexer that tokenizes the input Monkey code.
- Parser: The parser converts the tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- REPL: The interpreter provides a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for interactive code execution.

## Usage

To use the WebAssembly (WASM) version of the Monkey Lang Interpreter with wasm-bindgen.
